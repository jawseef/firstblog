            <p class="mythoughts">i owe this realization to the one and only, <em>Benjamin Xavier Rojas</em>, for showing me how to be HERE. He would greet everyone we passed by everytime. i go out a lot and no one does it like Ben. I do my best to greet everyone and have conversations with them because we are human. Do you say goodmorning to your fellow neighbors? Do you know anything about people other than your friends of friends, family, friends, family friends, etc. Why don’t we acknowledge everyone? We all got our own issues in our head but it's in our head, we are not what we think we are. So be out there befriend the unknown. We all feel lonely but why? There are approx 7 billion people, we all need help. Screw your own agenda and include others! Do nothing with a group, feel sad with a group! Be homeless with a group! They say family is all you got or friends, people is all you got WE ARE THE REAL THING!</p>

            <p>“life hasn’t yet taught you to understand that our finest gift has always been curiosity” - Jose Saramago</p>
            <br>
            <p class="mythoughts">no one knows the answers to all our questions but there is something wrong with someone getting impatient with someone for asking questions. in the media you can see kids are always asking “why” over and over and the adult is getting fed up. In the oldest of cinema you can see this, I mention this, because the media manipulates us on how to act. So the elders are seeing all these acts and by the time they have kids they are reenacting.see? We fit this saying, “monkey see monkey do” so much. SO always ask questions! Questions are the answers!</p>

            <p>“the only thing that last a whole lifetime is life itself, everything else is inevitably precarious, unstable, transient, time has taught me that one great truth” - Jose Saramago</p>
            <br>
            <p class="mythoughts">look at what's all around us. Outside and in our home. Up to the clothes on you. What is all this cool shit for? We are distracted from what is real and what matters. It is as if many do not even think, look at the CONSTANT pain we see in history or in our own families past. Everything is just a pattern that just repeats itself! Do we fear change?</p>

            <P>“never identify with that feeling. Don’t define your essential self in terms of that feeling. Don’t say ‘i am depressed.’ if you want to say ‘it is depressed’ that's all right. But not: I am gloomy. You’re defining yourself in terms of the feeling. That's your illusion; that's your mistake. ” - Anthony De Mello</P>

            <p class="mythoughts">i’ve been thinking a lot about languages. Languages are dying out. is english censorship? it's the most common language a lot of people can learn. When you translate something to english the english translation has a different tone compared to the foreign language. as well with more people bringing BACK pronouns. think about old english. Remember how they talked back then? “I conjure thee to speak to me. Speak as thou dost speak to Jonas and Mercy. Dost thou understand my English tongue? Answer me.” we have our modern day English because old English was too hard to understand! There is a way for us to speak without having to use the words “ I, me, my, you, he, she” but i still find it difficult.</p>

            <p>“Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We’re all going to die.”<br>
                “To live is to risk it all. Otherwise you’re just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.”<br>
                “Existence is pain”<br>
                “If i've learned one thing, it’s that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself”  - Rick and Morty</p>
             <p>“but since that immemorial day when a human face first say itself in the smooth surface of a pond and thought, Thats me” - Jose Saramago</p>

                <p class="mythoughts">listed all around this page are some of the most important affirmations i've ever read. the perspective they've given me and the way they make me think. and "make me" in an unevil sense. this pursuit of wisdom, it makes you want to act on because we have souls that are full of goodness! but then i get confused on how these saying exist and the world is still at a bad spot?<br>so i think about the greatest leaders or activist we've had and why does it seem as we depend on just one person to save the world? there is always the leader and their army. You'll always hear about the leaders, but not the army. if the leader gets taken out the army is lost and the fight for reason eventually just becomes a bliss. i wonder if leaders only need the people for reinforcement? and why wouldn't the whole army of people be classified as the leaders of the movement as well? the way i percieved historical events is i see someone rise up for the greater good and when the opposer gets rid of that person no justice is served and the idea of the greater good gets brushed off.<br>also when it is evident that change can happen in a day! the slogans "Power to the People" "Alone weak together strong" imply that the corrupted elites cannot win. IT'S TRUE, but the thing is we are being made to go against ourselves. now we're at a point where this has being going on for so long it's hard to go BACK. everyday i have trouble practicing what i preach, i'm only getting older and i can't seem to change!</p>
                <p class="mythoughts">⭐i do hope my thinking process makes some sense i can just ramble on⭐ i love the brain, look at where it can take you just by thinking! you're on some journey with your brain. the more you learn the more you learn about yourself and true capabilities. our knowledge and our true spirituality/capabalitites that have been made to look evil</p>
                <p>"they took our knowledge of spirituality, gave us a false religion and tricked us into believing our own knowledge was evil"- lawofunity</p>
                <p class="mythoughts"> thank you to benjamin, youre the one that taught me man, where i am now and the way i think is because of you.<br>every thought, question, or observation i have are meant for you only brother, we had the best conversations<br> "joseph you are the most analytic person that i have ever met"- BXR<br> never forget that, thank you hermano! we connected the dots! you gave the best input a true visionary god</p>
